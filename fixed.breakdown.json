      "key_info": "OpenAI is converting ChatGPT into an app platform and operating system, moving beyond traditional websites and mobile apps. This represents their biggest strategic bet, aiming to lock users into their ecosystem with 800 million weekly active users as the distribution opportunity.",
      "important_quotes": [
        "Your entire tech stack is deprecated",
        "The goal is to make ChatGPT like an operating system that you're completely locked into",
